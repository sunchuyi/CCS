"I am mostly interested in abstract interpretation and approximation methods with applications in any area of computer science, from semantics to static program analysis, software and hardware verification, model-checking and abstract model-checking, program transformation and optimization, software watermarking and code obfuscation, complexity and computability, logic and constraint-based programming, computer virology, security and safety critical systems. Recently I am more and more interested in applying these methods in security, digital asset protection, and in malware analysis. In all these fields I am interested in studying systematic methods for approximating undecidable or highly complex problems by means of formal methods such as abstract interpretation. I believe that abstract interpretation represents a unifying theory for understanding most phenomena connected with computation. In pure math I am interested in lattice theory and closure systems.

"Tim Cornwell has worked at the forefront of radio astronomical technical development for over 35 years. He has a PhD (1980) from the University of Manchester in England where he worked on image processing algorithms for radio synthesis telescopes. His first significant contribution was the development of the self-calibration algorithm widely used in radio astronomy. In 1980, he moved to Socorro, New Mexico to work on the newly completed Very Large Array telescope run by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. Over the 25 years at the NRAO, he made many contributions to radio astronomical techniques, including the key algorithms needed for wide fields of view: mosaicing wide fields, and w projection for correcting Fresnel diffraction for wide fields. In 1986, he used the CRAY-YMP at Digital Productions to produce the first 16 MPixel radio interferometric image. He also contributed in the areas of telescope design (for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array), telescope commissioning (the Very Long Baseline Array), observatory management, and software development. He has also consulted widely: NASA on the HST Aberration, the US Intelligence Community on approaches to combat terrorism, the Naval Research Laboratory on design of a space borne interferometric array, ESO on the configuration of the VLTI, NASA on the Spaceborne Interferometric Mission, and others. In 2004, he joined the Square Kilometre Array International Engineering Working Group, primarily to contribute towards computing and algorithms. In this role, together with colleagues from around the world, he conducted systematic investigations of SKA processing costs, SKA software development costs, and SKA software development methodology.

"Dr. Shang-Hua Teng has twice won the prestigious Gödel Prize in theoretical computer science, first in 2008, for developing the theory ofsmoothed analysis , and then in 2015, for designing the groundbreaking nearly-linear time Laplacian solver for network systems. Both are joint work with Dan Spielman of Yale --- his long-time collaborator. Smoothed analysis is fundamental for modeling and analyzing practical algorithms, and the Laplacian paradigm has since led to several breakthroughs in network analysis, matrix computation, and optimization. Citing him as, ``one of the most original theoretical computer scientists in the world'', the Simons Foundation named Teng a 2014 Simons Investigator, for pursuing long-term curiosity-driven fundamental research. He and his collaborators also received the best paper award atACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) for what's considered to be the ``first improvement in 10 years'' of a fundamental optimization problem --- the computation of maximum flows and minimum cuts in a network. In addition, he is known for his joint work with Xi Chen and Xiaotie Deng that characterized the complexity for computing an approximate Nash equilibrium in game theory, and his joint papers on market equilibria in computational economics. He and his collaborators also pioneered the development of well-shaped Dalaunay meshing algorithms for arbitrary three-dimensional geometric domains, which settled a long-term open problem in numerical simulation, also a fundamental problem in computer graphics. Software based on this development was used at the University of Illinois for the simulation of advanced rockets. Teng is also interested in mathematical board games. With his former Ph.D. student Kyle Burke, he designed and analyzed a game called Atropos , which is played on the Sperner's triangle and based on the beautiful, celebrated Sperner's Lemma. In 2000 at UIUC, Teng was named on the List of Teachers Ranked as Excellent by Their Students for his class, ``Network Security and Cryptography''.

From 1996-2005 he was on the faculty in the Center for Neuroscience at UC Davis, and in 2005 he moved to UC Berkeley. He also directs the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience, a multidisciplinary research group focusing on building mathematical and computational models of brain function (see http://redwood.berkeley.edu). Olshausen's research focuses on understanding the information processing strategies employed by the visual system for tasks such as object recognition and scene analysis. Computer scientists have long sought to emulate the abilities of the visual system in digital computers, but achieving performance anywhere close to that exhibited by biological vision systems has proven elusive. Dr. Olshausen's approach is based on studying the response properties of neurons in the brain and attempting to construct mathematical models that can describe what neurons are doing in terms of a functional theory of vision. The aim of this work is not only to advance our understanding of the brain but also to devise new algorithms for image analysis and recognition based on how brains work.",M,2018,Bruno Olshausen,https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/baolshausen.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
